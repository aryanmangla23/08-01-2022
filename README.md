Woke up at 7:30, ready to go to the gym. But, it's raining, so looks like no pool day and no gym today. Random thought insertion with no context: I hate more than you do. kayyy

**Growth is an endless process. Wrong to slightly less wrong. Certainty restricts growth. Trust yourself less**

JK, the weather cleared up. Pool with kevin, alex, and saahil was fun. My abs were so tired. I 100% burned a lot, cuz my body isn't used to swimming. Last time I swam, was 6 years ago. Played Water Polo basically except instead of a goal net, we had a hula hoop as the goal. Saahil was so burned and inted me. smh. 

After pool, went to Kevin's house with Alex and chilled for an 1.5 hour, played the binding of isaac for an hour, then went back home. Kind of useless, but whatever chill day so far. Also idk, when Alex asked me if I can take him home and I said no, I felt bad cuz I should have. But idk, I was just mega tired and wanted to go home as quickly as possible. Also, didn't want to waste gas cuz I was driving my dad's car. My brother's car which I drive will be back in september. Idk why i didnt say that, prbly cuz it would make me look like I'm cheap, but kay sux. If alex reads it, sorry dawg :< And I love yo mama's cooking :>>>

**I can be successful at something I'm willing to fail at**, Unwillingness to fail, means I an unwilling to succeed. Failure fear comes from shitty values aka American Education LOOOOOOOOOOOLL üòÇ. **Good metric to follow: Improve social life.** Not tangible external goals outside my own control, such as making everyon like my true personality. Also after just not stating why I didn't want to drop Alex: **maybe be more honest**. 

Success metric: Not big like "become a doctor", better small goals, dont make it better "Be fit, graduate college, get internship and research opportunities, and whatever is next". **It has to be values that are honest expressions of oneself.** 

**Physical pain to grow muscles, same way, emotional pain to develop greater emotional resilience, stronger sense of self, increased comoassion, and will make me more content.** In that way relating to one of my previous diaries, Thank you for fucking with me üòÖ. Wouldn't be where I am rn, and hopefully even more aware and even more mature by the end of the senior year. So by the end of december, this year was fabulous. Best year, I could have asked. Fell in love, anger and blame, heartbreak, increased social interaction towards may, claire, priscilla, soohyuk, kevin, joseph, alex for finals and ap study, Beginning of June ~ depressed at first, now I'm happy it happened because now she is out of my life and was able to infect someone else üòÑ. Entire month of July ~ work work work, hanging out with new friends, and now being more honest with myself üëç.** Will finish the rest on New Years :D**

**JUST SHUT UP AND DO IT. LIFE IS ABOUT NOT KNOWING AND DOING SOMETHING REGARDLESS**

Action, inspiration, motivation
