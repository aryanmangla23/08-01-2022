Woke up at 7:30, ready to go to the gym. But, it's raining, so looks like no pool day and no gym today. Random thought insertion with no context: I hate more than you do. kayyy

Growth is an endless process. Wrong to slightly less wrong. Certainty restricts growth. Trust yourself less

JK, the weather cleared up. Pool with kevin, alex, and saahil was fun. My abs were so tired. I 100% burned a lot, cuz my body isn't used to swimming. Last time I swam, was 6 years ago. Played Water Polo basically except instead of a goal net, we had a hula hoop as the goal. Saahil was so burned and inted me. smh. 

After pool, went to Kevin's house with Alex and chilled for an 1.5 hour, played the binding of isaac for an hour, then went back home. Kind of useless, but whatever chill day so far.
